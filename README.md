## Background
I wanted to make a robot dog for a very long time, so I am starting now.

## Project Structure
This project has been divided into three parts:
### Mechanical  
- CAD models of individual parts and assemblies  

### Software  
- Low-level driver code for actuators and sensors  
- Middleware for communication between hardware and higher-level logic  
- Higher-level control and autonomy (e.g., gait generation, stability, navigation)

### Hardware
- Power Distribution Board
- BMS

## Roadmap
